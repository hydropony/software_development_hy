Copilot came up with a good and functional solution. The UI looks great considering it only had CSS to work with. The code is well-structured and easy to follow, and functions have comments explaining their purpose. I learnt about a good way to use a global variable, though later when trying to fix pylint errors I had to refactor that part. I also learned about url_for function that I have not been using much before.
